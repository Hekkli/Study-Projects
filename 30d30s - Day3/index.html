                        In rough conditions at Thor’s Well, also known as Spouting Horn, the surf rushes into the gaping sinkhole and then shoots upwards with great force. It can be viewed by taking the Captain Cook Trail from the Cape Perpetua Scenic Area visitor centre – but for your own safety stay well back, especially at high tide or during winter storms.

                        The Giant’s Causeway is a natural reserve located in the vicinity of Bushmills, Northern Ireland. This nature’s wonder is unlike any other in the world – it consists of approximately 40 000 basalt columns which got included in UNESCO World Heritage Site list due to their rather peculiar shape. Although these rocks are actually the result of a volcanic eruption, there’s still a legend about them which says that the rocks were built by a giant (hence the name). In 1986 was opened Causeway Tourist Centre where you can get useful information about the site, exchange money and buy souvenirs.

                        Pamukkale, or Cotton Castle, is yet another natural reserve which makes people think “how is it even possible that something like that exists?” This natural site in Denizli, Turkey is one of most visited attractions in this country. Pamukkale is known for its thermal springs and white travertine terraces. The temperature in hot springs ranges from 35 °C up to boiling 100°C and most of them are not accessible to tourists. Tourists are only allowed to dip their feet in shallow pools and the entire area is shoe-free – which means you need to walk barefoot since these springs can easily get polluted.

                        What would you say if you needed to live in a place which has no roads at all? Impossible, right? Well, you were wrong. Fairytale-like village of Giethoorn is situated in Holland, in Overijssel province to be precise. It is a village entirely built on tiny islands connected by canals and over 180 wooden bridges. Popularly called the Dutch Venice, Giethoorn has been attracting tourists for decades but those who live there are even more lucky. The usual day in not so usual village consists of regular boat rides and every island has a walking path along the canals. Make sure you visit Giethoorn ‘t Olde Maat Uus Museum where you can see how the life in Giethoorn used to look like few centuries ago. All in all, we can agree on one thing for sure – it truly is an amazing place to visit!
